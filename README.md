# 04-Web-APIs---Code-Quiz

## Description

* For this homework I used HTML, Javascript and CSS to create a quiz about mountains. I was able to use all the skills that I have built up to this point to create this quiz. I learned how to create functions, hide obejects on a page, create timers, and much more! It was a good project to pull all my skills together and build something I could actually use! 

## Usage

* A timed quiz to test others about mountains. This game stores high scores so that the user can guage their progress compared to their peers.
